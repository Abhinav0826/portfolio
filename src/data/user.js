		title: "About Me",
		description:
			"Hi, I’m Abhinav Konda, a software developer from Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, and a recent B.Tech graduate from NIT Warangal. My experience there gave me a strong foundation in software development and a passion for solving real-world problems with code and intelligent systems. I’ve worked on several full-stack projects, including a startup website using React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS. I’m certified in Machine Learning from Udemy and completed an internship where my team developed an AI model for 5G channel modulation using Reinforcement Learning, improving data rates and reducing bit error rates. I also qualified for the second round of the Firefly Hackathon. Also contributed to organizing 4 Technozion and 3 SpringSpree events, NIT Warangal’s flagship fests. Beyond tech, I enjoy intraday trading, cooking, and playing guitar. I’m always looking to learn, grow, and create impactful solutions. Thanks for visiting—feel free to connect!",
